%I find it surprising that our university would require us to typeset our thesis using the Verdana font. Firstly, Verdana is a sans serif font, and traditionally, body text is typeset in a serif font. Secondly, Verdana is a commercially owned proprietary font, and it seems odd that a university would require their students to use any particular commercial product (though our university is supplying it to us for free)

This is your first paragraph for your controversy paper, and I guess it's the night before deadline. I just want this sentence to be very long,to show you that there is a difference between segment spacing and line spacing,and I succeed\citep*{torre2015global}.

\par%这是换段命令
This is your second paragraph,I don't know what you want to write,but I want to show you how to cite a whole paragraph of quotation\citep*{gao2017highly}.As President Mao said:

\begin{quotation}%这是引用整段quotation的命令
Feng ZiMou is a good comrade,the most excellent child in the kindergarten.An enthysuastic person who develped this template.
\end{quotation}

\par
This is your third paragraph,you are so close to your finishment of homework,well done and congratulations!You are so excellent that I guess you must have accepted the nine-year compulsory education.
